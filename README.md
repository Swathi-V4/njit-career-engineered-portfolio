## Project Purpose
A career-engineered portfolio demonstrating AI orchestration (strategy → AGENTS.md source-of-truth → build) and deployment on GitHub Pages for a job-seeking professional presence.

## Orchestration Log (AI Mistake + Fix)
During development, the AI initially leaned toward unnecessary complexity (a heavier framework-style setup) that wasn’t needed for GitHub Pages. I pushed back and pivoted to a lightweight HTML/CSS/JS stack to deploy faster and keep the architecture simple and reliable.
